# Compton Scattering With Relativistic Electrons

Compton scattering occurs when a photon interacts with a stationary electron and imparts a portion of its kinetic energy and momentum to it. This effect is well-known and has its uses in medical imaging and radiation therapy. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the interaction of photons and relativistic electrons is common in astrophysical phenomena such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei. Low energy photons are scattered to high energies by relativistic electrons so that the photons gain and the electrons lose energy. This process is called inverse Compton scattering because the electrons lose energy rather than the photons, the opposite of the standard Compton effect. In both these effects, the particles energy and momenta are exchanged and their trajectories altered after collision. In this paper, we derive equations for the energy and wavelength of a scattered photon for a more general case when the photon is collided at an arbitrary angle $\phi$ by an electron moving initially at relativistic speeds.
